# ROS Index Development

ROS Index is a statically-generated website which is composed of four main components:

1. A Jekyll backbone
2. A Jekyll Ruby plugin which clones and analyzes ROS repositories
3. HTML templates for displaying content
4. Build-side and client-side javascript for searching the index

Everything used to build ROS Index can be found on the [rosindex GitHub
organization](http://github.com/rosindex).

## Building ROSIndex

See the [ROS Index README.md](http://github.com/rosindex/rosindex)
for details on building ROS Index locally.

## Design Patterns

### Pagination

Currently, pagination of `N` total items is done by generating html files for
each page of `n` items and each `m` ways of sorting those items. This leads to
`n*(m+1)` html pages (`+1` for the default sort, whichever that may be). This
also constrains the display to display only `N/n` items at a time.
